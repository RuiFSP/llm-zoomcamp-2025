# Agents Module

## Key Topics from Class Materials

- **Agentic RAG**: Explored agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and its applications.
- **Function Calling**: Learned how to define and use tools/functions (e.g., `get_weather`) for agents.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Introduction to MCP for agent communication and orchestration.
- **Practical Implementation**: Used Python scripts and notebooks to build and test agent tools.
