## Module Summaries

### Module 1: Introduction to LLMs and RAG

In this module, I learned the fundamentals of:

- **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Understanding their capabilities and limitations
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Learning the architecture and components of RAG systems
- **Search Techniques**: 
  - Using MinSearch for lightweight in-memory search with TF-IDF vectorization
  - Setting up and configuring Elasticsearch for more robust search capabilities
  - Implementing `multi_match` queries to search across multiple document fields
- **OpenAI Integration**: Connecting to OpenAI API to generate responses based on retrieved context
- **End-to-End RAG Pipeline**: Building a complete system that:
  - Indexes Zoomcamp FAQ documents
  - Retrieves relevant documents based on user queries
  - Augments prompts with retrieved context
  - Generates answers using LLMs

**Projects & Homework**:
- Implemented a Q&A system for answering questions about Zoomcamp course FAQs
- Worked with Elasticsearch 8.x for document indexing and retrieval
- Created structured prompts with retrieved context for accurate LLM responses
