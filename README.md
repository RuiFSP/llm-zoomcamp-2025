## Module Summaries

### Module 1: Introduction to LLMs and RAG

In this module, I learned the fundamentals of:

- **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Understanding their capabilities and limitations
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Learning the architecture and components of RAG systems
- **Search Techniques**: 
  - Using MinSearch for lightweight in-memory search with TF-IDF vectorization
  - Setting up and configuring Elasticsearch for more robust search capabilities
  - Implementing `multi_match` queries to search across multiple document fields
- **OpenAI Integration**: Connecting to OpenAI API to generate responses based on retrieved context
- **End-to-End RAG Pipeline**: Building a complete system that:
  - Indexes Zoomcamp FAQ documents
  - Retrieves relevant documents based on user queries
  - Augments prompts with retrieved context
  - Generates answers using LLMs

**Projects & Homework**:
- Implemented a Q&A system for answering questions about Zoomcamp course FAQs
- Worked with Elasticsearch 8.x for document indexing and retrieval
- Created structured prompts with retrieved context for accurate LLM responses

### Module 2: Vector Search

In this module, I learned about vector-based search techniques:

- **Embedding Models**: Working with models like Jina and BAAI/bge to convert text into numerical vectors
- **Semantic Similarity**: Calculating cosine similarity between embeddings to find related content
- **Vector Databases**: Setting up and using Qdrant for efficient vector storage and retrieval
- **Search Optimization**: 
  - Comparing results from different text fields (text-only vs. question + text)
  - Evaluating the impact of embedding model selection on search quality
  - Understanding dimensionality trade-offs in vector embeddings
- **Hybrid Search**: Combining dense vector search with sparse/keyword-based approaches like BM25
- **End-to-End Vector Search Pipeline**: Building a complete system that:
  - Processes and embeds documents with combined fields
  - Indexes vectors in a specialized vector database
  - Retrieves semantically similar documents based on user queries
  - Ranks results by relevance scores

**Projects & Homework**:
- Built a vector search system using Qdrant and FastEmbed
- Experimented with different embedding models and dimensions
- Analyzed how field selection impacts search relevance
- Created a production-ready vector search collection for ML Zoomcamp FAQs

### Workshop 1: Open-Source Data Ingestion

In this workshop, I learned about data ingestion tools for RAG applications:

  - Creating resource definitions for data extraction
  - Configuring destinations for vector database integration
  - Running pipelines to extract, transform, and load document data
  - Using local storage for development environments
  - Understanding collection metadata and configuration
  - Analyzing model configurations (384-dimensional vectors, cosine distance)
  - Understanding how embeddings are stored and indexed
  - Different search types (GRAPH_COMPLETION, RAG_COMPLETION)
  - Using NodeSets for focused searches
  - Querying API documentation with semantic understanding

### Workshop 2: Agents & MCP Workshop - Completed on July 2025

In this bonus module, I explored agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (Agentic RAG) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

- **Agentic RAG**: Learned how agents can orchestrate retrieval and generation tasks, enabling more dynamic and flexible workflows.
- **Function Calling**: Implemented tools/functions (e.g., `get_weather`) for agents to interact with external data and APIs.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Studied MCP for agent communication, tool management, and orchestration in multi-agent systems.
- **Practical Implementation**: Built and tested agent tools using Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

**Projects & Homework**:
- Developed a weather tool for agents and defined function descriptions for agentic workflows
- Practiced function calling with OpenAI and custom agents
- Added and tested new tools for updating weather data
- Explored MCP client usage for agent orchestration
